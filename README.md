## Introduction

Location Alarm is a Flutter app that allows users to set alarms based on their location. Users can specify a particular area on the map and set an alarm, so when they enter that location, the alarm will be triggered. This app aims to provide a convenient way for users to be alerted when they reach specific locations, such as their home, office, or any other place of interest.
